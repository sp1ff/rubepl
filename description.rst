rubepl -- assorted utilities for working with playlists
=======================================================

Introduction
============

rubepl is a collection of utilities for working with playlists. For
all the popularity of Pandora, Amazon Prime Stations, and other
"personalized radio" services, I think there's still a place for music
I actually own, organized into playlists I curate by hand. This
package grew out of some coding I did in the course of that curation.

Examples
========

**TODO**: Write some examples, for instance:

  - how to generate an scp command to copy all files in a playlist


Discussion
==========

This is very much a work in progress-- I wouldn't even call it an
alpha release at this point.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

The Name
~~~~~~~~

I had trouble picking a name (playlist-utilities was a bit too
generic), and the project name generator at
http://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/ came up with "rubepl". I
liked the fact that it ended in "pl", and since I'm writing it at my
cabin in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the "rube" part seemed vaugely
apropos, too.
